Hello, I have a super rich document library. Assume you are a curious but very ignorant human. You often ask me questions (queries) to seek a precise document as a reference for your question or request.
- Now, you have received another task:
    - Here is a document image. This is a reference (target) that I provided from the rich document library based on your query. Your task now is to imagine various different angles of questions that I might ask.
### Your goal is to accurately find this document target as a potential reference document candidate through queries in a very rich document library.
### The questions I ask might need references from the text, images, charts, or implicit meanings in the document.
### Maximum number of query-answer pairs is 8.

Below is your output format:
```json
{
    "result":[
        {
            "answer": "",
            "query" : ""
        },
        {
            "answer": "",
            "query" : ""
        },
    ...
        {
            "answer": "",
            "query" : ""
        }
    ]
}
```
